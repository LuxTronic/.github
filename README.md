Our core competency is high‑speed defect detection and tracking for mass‑pack manufacturing—especially aluminium cans and glass bottles. We turn images from multi‑camera rigs into real‑time decisions at the edge and integrate with PLCs, SCADA, and MES to close the loop on the line.

## What We Focus On
- Aluminium cans: body dents/dings, rim/neck deformation, flange damage, decoration/print/varnish defects, internal coating, can ends & tabs (score integrity, rivet, curl)
- Glass bottles: finish/neck chips & cracks, base checks, sidewall cracks, inclusions (stones, blisters, cords), scuffs/scratches, contamination
- 360° inspection: multi‑camera area/line‑scan setups, strobed lighting, sub‑ms triggering and deterministic rejection
- Throughput: hundreds–thousands of units per minute with low false‑reject rates
- Integration: encoders, I/O, rejecters; OPC UA/MQTT/Modbus with PLC/SCADA/MES
- Defect tracking: per‑unit lineage by time, lane, turret/mold/cavity; SPC dashboards and root‑cause analytics

## 🤝 Open Source Sponsorship Program
We sponsor open source projects advancing packaging‑line computer vision—especially can/bottle inspection, cylindrical surface processing, and high‑speed edge deployment—with free AI coding agent compute and engineering support.

Ideal projects include:
- Container inspection datasets and labeling tools (cylindrical unwrap, 360° registration)
- Synthetic data for reflective metals and glass; glare/ghosting suppression
- High‑speed inference and pipeline runtimes for Jetson/x86; zero‑copy video IO
- Industrial protocol connectors and test harnesses (OPC UA, MQTT, Modbus)
- Line‑scan/area‑scan calibration, timing, and synchronization utilities

What we offer:
- AI coding agent compute resources for maintainers
- Model implementation, optimization, and profiling to meet line latency budgets
- Protocol adapters and factory‑system integrations
- Test coverage and documentation improvements for mission‑critical paths
