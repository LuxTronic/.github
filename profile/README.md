# ⚙️ LuxTronic AI  
### Industrial Computer Vision & Edge AI for High-Speed Manufacturing

We build real-time inspection and manufacturing-intelligence systems for mass-pack production—especially aluminium cans and glass bottles. Our software turns images from multi-camera rigs into on-line decisions and integrates with PLCs, SCADA, and MES to close the loop on the line.

## **6.4B inspections in 2025**

In 2025 alone, LuxTronic systems inspected **over 6.4 billion units** in live, high-speed production environments across aluminium can and glass bottle lines worldwide.

## 🏭 What We Build

LuxTronic designs **real-time, high-throughput inspection systems** for high-volume manufacturing:

- **Aluminium Cans:** dents/dings, rim/neck deformation, flange damage, varnish/print defects, internal coating, ends & tabs (score, rivet, curl)  
- **Glass Bottles:** finish/neck cracks, base checks, inclusions, sidewall cracks, contamination, blister/cord/stones  
- **360° Vision Rigs:** multi-camera area/line-scan, strobed lighting, sub-ms triggering, deterministic reject timing  
- **Edge AI Systems:** sub-millisecond inference across Jetson/x86; optimized pipelines with deterministic latency  
- **Industrial Integration:** encoders, digital I/O, rejecters; OPC UA / MQTT / Modbus; PLC, SCADA, MES connectivity  

Our systems produce **rich defect tracking and per-unit lineage** (time, lane, turret/mold/cavity) and feed into SPC dashboards, trend analytics, and automated response logic.
